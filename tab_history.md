# History

This page tells a bit of the **OWASP Lisboa** Chapter history. Actually, this chapter builds on top of a former **OWASP Portugal** Chapter, that existed between 2008 and 2018. During this period, the OWASP Portuguese Chapter, helped disseminate the OWASP mission in Portugal, throughout the organization and participation on multiple events, meetups and the collaboration on some projects.

An older version and archived version of the chapter page can be [found here](https://web.archive.org/web/20170324093023/https://owasp.org/index.php/Portugal).
