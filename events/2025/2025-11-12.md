### From Secure Design to Responsible AI Development - Celfocus Approach

As AI solutions mature and are integrated into real-world environments, new classes of security gaps are emerging. This session takes a practical look at how vulnerabilities can appear throughout the AI lifecycle, from the early design phase to day-to-day operation. Using concrete examples such as prompt injection, data exposure and jailbreak attacks, it highlights how subtle oversights can quickly become exploitable weaknesses.

The talk then walks through a Security by Design approach tailored for AI, covering threat modelling, privacy-preserving techniques, secure development, testing strategies, and continuous monitoring. The focus is on applying structured security controls across six key stages: planning and design, data processing, model development, verification, deployment, and operational monitoring.

It will also touch on proven defensive measures and industry standards like the OWASP Top 10 LLMs and MITRE ATLAS, showing how they can be applied in real projects. The aim isn’t just to avoid incidents, but to build trustworthy, responsible AI systems from the ground up.
