### Can APIs Be the Silent Players in the Social Engineering Game?

This talk delves into the pervasive yet often overlooked role of APIs in the realm of social engineering. Through a comprehensive exploration of case studies, security vulnerabilities and ethical considerations, this talk uncovers the hidden risks associated with APIs and gives you proactive measures to mitigate the potential for social engineering attacks facilitated by these silent weapons.

### ~~Jedi~~GenAI Mind Tricks - Are these the secure chatbots you’re looking for?

After experimenting with various public challenges on LLM chatbots—like Gandalf, PromptAirlines, and more—I decided to build my own. Not just to understand how LLMs work, but to see how easily I could break them.

In this talk, I’ll dive into the security risks of Generative AI, particularly LLM chatbots, and explore vulnerabilities that are often overlooked. From sensitive information disclosure to prompt injections and jailbreaking, I’ll walk through real-world examples showing just how these systems can be manipulated.
