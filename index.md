## Welcome to the OWASP Lisboa chapter
Welcome to the new OWASP Lisboa chapter. This new portuguese local chapter, builds on the previous experience of the previous existing portuguese OWASP chapter, that was active between 2008 and 2018. 

The objective of this chapter is to promote application security in Portugal, through the engagement of the local community, meetings and events organization, and project participation.

### Seeing What’s Wrong Just Right
"Writing web applications is hard. Debugging them is harder. Security bugs are even harder because not only does an application have to work, it has to stop working when the input is malicious. One approach web developers have taken to managing the complexity of writing large web programs is to make it harder to write incorrect programs. Static type checkers, linters, tests and testing frameworks have all made it easier to write correct code. Nevertheless, incorrect and vulnerable programs still exist. In fact, the very success of these tools in avoiding common errors has meant developers spend increasing amounts of time debugging only subtle bugs. In distributed systems, the challenge is even harder because debugging tools give you glimpses into the program state—some on the server, some on the client—without giving you a coherent view of the entire system. Not only are web programs inherently distributed between the server and the client, any one web page in the browser is itself made up of different iframes, events and event handlers, and sometimes service workers all communicating asynchronously. In this talk, I will share a few painful distributed web app debugging anecdotes and an alternate approach to get a holistic view of a program to track down elusive bugs. This approach uses virtualization to create complete traces of just those aspects of the program we suspect are buggy without having to model all program state. Virtualization allows us to momentarily ignore incidental bugs discovered while hunting the core one without it getting in the way, and visualization of the collected traces to build up causal diagrams to inform our intuition when our mental models deviate from reality. I will demonstrate how to recognize and tackle debugging problems with this approach and cover pitfalls you may run into with virtualization."

### Why everyone in your cyber security team needs to be an AI expert
"Similar to how electricity revolutionised our lives and is now ubiquitous, Gen AI is poised to become an integral part of everything Cyber Security teams do everyday. Therefore, there is an increasing need to deepen our understanding and expertise in this transformative technology. It's time to embrace the opportunities AI presents and equip ourselves with the knowledge to thrive in this rapidly evolving landscape."

Beginner or advanced, attack or defense, technical or not, submit your talk [here](https://lnkd.in/ecCrhWUx).

### Sponsorship

The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software. All of our projects ,tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application security.

Chapters are led by local leaders in accordance with the [Chapters Policy](/www-policy/operational/chapters). Financial contributions should only be made online using the authorized online donation button.

Everyone is welcome and encouraged to participate in our [Projects](/projects/), [Local Chapters](/chapters/), [Events](/events/), [Online Groups](https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.com/){:target='_blank'}, and [Community Slack Channel](https://owasp.slack.com/){:target='_blank'}. We especially encourage diversity in all our initiatives. OWASP is a fantastic place to learn about application security, to network, and even to build your reputation as an expert. We also encourage you to be [become a member](/membership/) or consider a [donation](/donate/) to support our ongoing work.
