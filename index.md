## Welcome to the OWASP Lisboa chapter

Welcome to the new OWASP Lisboa chapter. This local chapter builds on the experience of the previous OWASP chapter which was active between 2008 and 2018 (see [History](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-lisboa/#div-history)).

The goal of this chapter is to promote application security in Portugal, engaging the local community through meetings, speaking events, and project contributions.
